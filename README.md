# RACS-Glove---Robotic-Arm-Control-Glove

This project presents a wireless glove-based control system designed for the teleoperation of a 7-DoF robotic arm. Developed as a user-friendly, responsive, and ergonomic solution, the system integrates a 9-DoF IMU for accurate motion sensing and real-time data processing using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W. The glove allows intuitive control of robotic arm movements, demonstrating potential applications in diverse fields such as remote surgeries, hazardous material handling, and automation. This repository contains all the necessary code and documentation to replicate and expand upon the system.
